# Image-Identification-Cats-vs-Dogs-
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN). The model learns to differentiate between the two classes based on image  features like edges, textures, and shapes. 
# Problem Statement:
Identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog is a fundamental computer vision task. 
Traditional algorithms struggle with complex patterns in images, making deep learning a more 
effective solution.
# Learning Outcomes: 
● Understanding CNN architecture (convolutional layers, pooling, fully connected layers) 
● Preprocessing and augmenting image datasets 
● Training and fine-tuning CNN models using TensorFlow/Keras
